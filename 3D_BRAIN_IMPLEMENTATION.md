# 3D Interactive Brain Model Implementation

## Overview
Replaced the static 2D brain image in the hero section with an interactive 3D brain model using Three.js and React Three Fiber.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Installed
- `three` - Core 3D library
- `@react-three/fiber` - React renderer for Three.js
- `@react-three/drei` (already installed) - Helper components for React Three Fiber

### 2. New Component Created
**File:** `src/components/home/Brain3D.jsx`

Features:
- **Interactive 3D Brain Model** with distortion effects
- **Animated Neurons** - 50 pulsing spheres distributed around the brain
- **Neural Connections** - Lines connecting nearby neurons
- **Auto-rotation** - Gentle automatic rotation
- **User Controls** - Drag to rotate, auto-returns to rotation
- **Responsive Design** - Adapts to mobile and desktop screens
- **Pink/Purple Theme** - Matches your brand colors (#ff69b4, #ffb5ea)

### 3. Hero Component Updated
**File:** `src/components/home/hero/index.jsx`

Changes:
- Commented out old 2D image code (preserved for reference)
- Commented out unused state variables and mouse handlers
- Commented out unused imports
- Added Brain3D component import
- Replaced image div with Brain3D component

## Features of the 3D Brain

1. **Main Brain Sphere**
   - Distorting material that creates organic movement
   - Pink color (#ff69b4) with metallic finish
   - Smooth 64x64 segment sphere for quality

2. **Neurons**
   - 50 small spheres positioned around the brain
   - Pulsing animation (each with unique delay)
   - Emissive pink glow effect

3. **Neural Network**
   - Automatic connections between nearby neurons
   - Semi-transparent pink lines
   - Creates a network visualization

4. **Lighting**
   - Ambient light for overall illumination
   - Directional light for depth
   - Pink point light for atmosphere
   - Spotlight for dramatic effect

5. **Interactivity**
   - Auto-rotates slowly
   - Users can drag to rotate
   - Zoom disabled for consistent view
   - Pan disabled to keep brain centered
   - Rotation limits to keep brain upright

## How to Use

The component is automatically loaded in the hero section. No additional configuration needed.

To adjust the brain appearance, edit `Brain3D.jsx`:
- Change colors in the material properties
- Adjust neuron count (line 22)
- Modify rotation speed (line 152)
- Change distortion amount (line 41)

## Performance Notes

- Uses WebGL for hardware acceleration
- Optimized with proper geometry reuse
- Responsive and works on mobile devices
- Transparent background blends with page

## Reverting to Old Image

If you want to revert to the old 2D image:
1. Uncomment the imports at the top of `hero/index.jsx`
2. Uncomment the state variables and handlers
3. Uncomment the image div code
4. Comment out or remove the Brain3D import and component

## Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers that support WebGL:
- Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera

Note: Older browsers or devices without WebGL support will need a fallback.
